## Setting up locally

To set up locally, clone the repository and navigate to the `frontend` subdirectory.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20+
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Setup

1. Copy the example environment file to `.env` and update the values as needed.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. Use the node version defined in .nvmrc.

    ```bash
    nvm use
    ```

3. Install the NPM dependencies.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Build the packages.

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

5. Publish packages locally.

    ```bash
    npm run publish:local
    ```

Alternatively, you could build the packages in watch mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Code Contributions (Pull Requests)

### Workflow

The `develop` branch is used for active development, while `main` contains the current stable release. Always create a new branch from `develop` when working on a new feature or bug fix.

Branches should be prefixed with the type of change (e.g. `feat`, `chore`, `tests`, `fix`, etc.) followed by a short description of the change. For example, a branch for a new feature called "Add new feature" could be named `feat/add-new-feature`.

### Code Quality / Code Standards

This project uses several tools to ensure code quality and standards are maintained:

#### ESLint

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org), which is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

You can run ESLint using the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

ESLint can automatically fix some issues. To fix issues automatically, run:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### Testing

#### Testing with Jest

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to run unit tests
.
Unit tests are located inside the /packages/\*\*/test/ directory

To run the unit tests, run:

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

To generate coverage report, run:

```bash
npm run test:unit:coverage
```

To update the snapshot, run:

```bash
npm run test:unit:updatesnapshot
```

Note: Update snapshots when a test fails due to intentional changes in the code.

#### Testing with Playwright.

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to run e2e tests.

Tests are located in the [`e2e-tests`](./e2e-tests) directory.

To run the Playwright tests, run:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Type checking

You can run type check for all packages:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

### Testing packages locally

You can test these packages locally by linking them, or by using a local npm registry such as Verdaccio.

#### Using linking (recommended for local development)

1. Follow steps 1â€“3 in [Setup](#setup).
2. Run `npm link -w snapwp` to link the package into your global dependencies.
3. Verify the CLI by running `snapwp`.
4. Remove the global link with `npm r snapwp -g`.

#### Using Verdaccio (recommended for pre-release testing)

1. Follow steps 1â€“4 in [Setup](#setup).
2. Use `npm_config_registry=http://localhost:4873 npx snapwp` to run the local package.
3. Clear the npx cache if needed:
    - Find your cache location using `npm config get cache`.
    - Remove the `_npx` directory in that cache folder.

#### Using the packages in `/examples/`

@todo

### Releasing

As will all other Code Contributions, the release process is managed through Pull Requests. When you are ready to make a release, create a new branch from `develop` and make the necessary changes, and then create a PR.

Once the PR is merged, you should push a copy of the `develop` branch to the `main` branch.
