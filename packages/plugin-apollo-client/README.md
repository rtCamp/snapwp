# @snapwp/plugin-apollo-client

**Apollo Client adapter for [SnapWP](../../README.md)**.

This package is a wrapper around the [`@apollo/client` library](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client), providing seamless integration with the SnapWP framework.

SnapWP's query system and configuration API are built to support any GraphQL client that extends its `QueryEngine` interface. This extension makes it easy to use Apollo Client as the underlying engine for data fetching within the SnapWP ecosystem.
