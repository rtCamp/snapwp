## Static Exports

Static exports are a way to generate static HTML pages for your application. This is useful for improving performance and SEO. In this section, we will cover how to set up static exports in your application.
SnapWP supports static exports out of the box. Our Example app is already set up to support static exports.

[!NOTE]
As the static exports are supported by SnapWP out of the box, SnapWP doesn't use any NextJS Dyanmic APIs i.e Headers, SearchParams. For more unsupported features of Static exports, please refer to the [NextJS documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/static-exports#unsupported-features).
